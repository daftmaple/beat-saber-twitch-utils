# Browser support

This project uses default [Browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) support: `> 0.5%, last 2 versions, Firefox ESR, not dead`. As of the time this project is documented (September 10, 2021), supported browsers are:

```
<--
  generated by:
  yarn browserslist "> 0.5%, last 2 versions, Firefox ESR, not dead"
-->
<FILL THIS ON MERGE REQUEST>
```

This project does not use Google Analytics, hence I can't analyse the incoming traffic and set the right browserslist query.

## TTS

Text to speech uses Speech Synthesis API

To check whether your browser supports Speech Synthesis API, refer to [caniuse Speech Synthesis API](https://caniuse.com/speech-synthesis).
